["bay-area-rent-price-predictor.html", "My first cool idea Apartment hunting. Rent price predictor. New home.", " My first cool idea Keywords bubble, housing, home price, rent, bay area Apartment hunting. My wife and I just moved back to San Francisco Bay Area and have looked for a 2bd house or apartnment in Millbrae, Burlingame, and San Mateo. Price range for a 2bd house or apartment in these cities is from $2.7k to $4.0k per month which is a lot higher than a median price for a 2bd house or apartment in the USA. We have spent more than 30 hours respectively to search for available options without knowing whether houses or apartments we have found have the right price. As 90,000 people moved in from July 2014 to July 2015 to San Francisco Bay Area, we could have wasted 2.7M hours collectively. In this context, I’d like to prevent incoming residents in San Francisco Bay Area from wasting time by showing how likely a rent price would go up or down. Rent price predictor. When you search for flights or hotels in Google, Kayak or in online travel sites, it is not difficult to see them indicating whether your options are best deals or not, or whether prices are expected to go up or not. Shouldn’t we have the same capability for rents? That’s why I introduce you the Bay Area Rent Price Predictor. Based on the historical data of house or apartment sales and rents in this area, the predictor should be able to identify upward or downward trends in terms of home prices and rents and to even suggest the dates when newcomers are encouraged to move in San Francisco Bay Area. New home. When people considering a move from different cities look for a place to rent in San Francisco Bay Area, they would be able to make a quick and right decision (pass/visit/apply) since the rent price predictor shows whether a rent price is within a range and how likely the price goes up or down in a foreseeable future. As a result, they will save more than 2.7M hours and money collectively and find places at the right prices in San Francisco Bay Area. "],
["smart-body-scanner.html", "My second cool idea I missed my flight. Dynamic threshold. Never miss your flight.", " My second cool idea Keywords passenger-scanning, TSA, delay, airport I missed my flight. I arrived at Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Atlanta, GA one and a half hour before my flight back to San Francisco. Since it was a domestic flight, I naively thought I could make it, but I missed the flight. It took more than 1 hour to go through the security check at the airport. Delays in the security check are mainly caused by additional manual checks when the body scanners beep alarms, but these alarms are false positive in most cases. According to FAA, more than 2.5M domestic/international passengers fly every day. If we can reduce the false positives, we would save lots of time wasted at the airports collectively. Dynamic threshold. How many times have you seen a traveler being called out for an additional search after the body scanner and a TSA agent find nothing? It is believed that 9 out of 10 cases are false positives, and they are the biggest cause of delays in the security check. Smart Body Scanner is a software which can be easily applied to various body scanners used across different airports. Smart Body Scanner dynamically adjusts a threshold based on traveler’s security check and travel history when his or her passport is scanned before the body scanner. It can be also trained based on the scanned images collected from other body scanners. For example, the body scanner would be less sensitive when those who have traveled a lot and have not been additionally screened come through it. However, the body scanner would become more sensitive for first-time travelers and those who have the records. Smart Body Scanner will dramatically decrease the false positives. Never miss your flight. No more long lines in the security check when you arrive at the airport for your next flight with Smart Body Scanner. As the body scanner only picks the potential threats with much lower false positives, TSA agents can pay more attention to them, and are not required to work overtime to help alleviate the long lines. In addition, the shorter lines in the security check would help save lots of time collectively for more than 2.5M passengers flying every day. While lowering false positives is the primary benefit from Smart Body Scanner, no one wants to see false negatives go into any flights. Therefore, Smart Body Scanner will randomly lower its threshold to prevent them. Smart Body Scanner will bring no more delays and missing flights with security at the airport.
