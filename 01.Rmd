## A beginning.

My wife and I just moved back to San Francisco Bay Area and have looked for a 2bd house in Millbrae, Burlingame, and San Mateo. Price range for a 2bd house in these cities is from $2.7k to $4.0k per month which is a lot higher than a median price for a 2bd house in the USA. We have spent more than 30 hours respectively to search for available options without knowing whether houses we have found have the right price. As 90,000 people moved in from July 2014 to July 2015, we could have wasted 2.7M hours collectively. In this context, Iâ€™d like to prevent incoming residents in San Francisco Bay Area from wasting time by presenting only houses whose prices are expected to go up.
