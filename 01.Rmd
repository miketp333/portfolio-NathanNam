## A beginning.

My wife and I just moved back to San Francisco Bay Area and have looked for a 2bd house in Millbrae, Burlingame, and San Mateo. Price range for a 2bd house in these cities is from $2.7k to $4.0k per month which is a lot higher than a median price for a 2bd house in the USA. We have spent more than 30 hours respectively to search for available options without knowing whether houses we have found have the right price. As 90,000 people moved in from July 2014 to July 2015, we could have wasted 2.7M hours collectively. In this context, I’d like to prevent incoming residents in San Francisco Bay Area from wasting time by showing how likely a rent price would go up or down.

## A middle.
When you search for flights or hotels in Google or in online travel sites, it is not difficult to see them indicating whether your options are best deals or not, or whether prices are expected to go up or not. This kind of information have influenced your decision so far. 
Shouldn’t we have the same capability for rents? That’s why I introduce you the Bay Area Rent Price Predictor. Based on the historical data of house sales and rents in this area, the predictor should be able to identify upward or downward trends in terms of home prices and rents and to even suggest the dates when newcomers are encouraged to move in San Francisco Bay Area.

## An end.

When a newcomer looks for a place to rent in San Francisco Bay Area, he or she would be able to make a quick and right decision (pass/visit/apply) since the rent price predictor shows whether a rent price is within a range and how likely the price goes up or down in a foreseeable future. As a result, newcomers will save more than 2.7M hours and money collectively and find places at the right prices in San Francisco Bay Area.
