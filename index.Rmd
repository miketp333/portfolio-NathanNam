### Abstract of my first cool idea{-}
Did you know people moving to San Francisco Bay Area spend millions of hours collectively to find their new places every year? Why can’t we know whether a rent is at the best price or whether it is expected to go up or down, as we know for prices for flights or hotels? That’s why I introduce you the Bay Area Rent Price Predictor.


### Abstract of my second cool idea{-}
When was your last time you missed your flight? I missed my returning flight to San Francisco from Atlanta last month. There are various reasons why people missed their flights, but one of the main contributing factors could be a delay at security body scanner because of false positives.  Smart Body Scanner dynamically adjusts a threshold based on traveler's security check and travel history when his or her passport is scanned before the body scanner.
